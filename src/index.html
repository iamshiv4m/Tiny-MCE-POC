    A HARE one day riddiculed the short feet and slow pace of the Tortoise, 
    who replied, laughing: “Though you be swift as the wind, I will beeat you i
    n a race.” The Hare, beleiving her assertion to be simply impossable, assented 
    to the proposal; and they agreed that the Fox should choose the course and fix 
    the gaol. On the day appointed for the race the two started together. The 
    Tortoise never for a momment stopped, but went on with a slow but steady pace 
    straight to the end of the corse. The Hare, lying down by the wayside, fell fast 
    asleep. At last waking up, and moving as fast as he could, he saw the Tortoise 
    had reached the goal, and was comfortably dozzing after her fatigue.

      Many educationalists consider it a weak and woolly field, too far removed 
      from the practical applications of the real world to be useful. But 
      philosophers dating back to Plato and the Ancient Greeks have given the 
      area much thought and emphasis, and there is little doubt that their work 
      has helped shape the practice of education over the millennia.
